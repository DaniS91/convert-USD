## Known Bugs

* _I have a major issue in my ExchangeService-API accounts that I have tried to resolve_
_My API request always returns an error-type of either invalid-key or inactive-account. I have created multiple accounts and used the supplied confirmation link to confirm and activate my accounts, but none of my API keys work to produce a valid request, even after testing in Postman. I also tried emailing the support team for the service and creating a Pro account_
